🎬 Movie Recommendation System with Python and MySQL 🍿

I’ve developed a mini project using #Python and #MySQL
that recommends movies based on your chosen genre.


This system fetches movies from a MySQL database and provides recommendations either randomly or based on the number of movies you want to see. 
It’s a fun way to decide what to watch next! 🎥
